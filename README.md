# ArKey
Simple Serial Program to Connect to Arduino UNO to Use as a keyboard shortcut/keyboard emulator.

For an Example for the Arduino Code, Look Under the Keyboard2 Folder.

Can be used for any Arduino Like Device Arduino/ESP8266/ESP32

### Note:
This code is really not professional in anyway, it was more for that I wanted to make something. If it breaks, well you get the point.
